# StrategoOnline
A game project for our javascript class in Junia ISEN Lille (CIR2), it's a basic stratego with a working server, working with socket io, express and babylon js.
If you want to know the rules, just look up online at the stratego game rules.

## Compiling:
Just clone the projet, run `npm install` in the main folder, and the `node index` to launch the node server.
